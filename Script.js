//I have included document pointers for the outputText and the userResponse.
//You need to figure out how to take the user's response and then update the 
//output text to prompt them again. If you want to get more advanced I 
//recommend trying to change the prompt the user gets, resetting the text 
//in the input area when the user presses enter, and other things you want.

const outputText = document.querySelector(".outputText");
const userResponse = document.querySelector(".userResponse");
